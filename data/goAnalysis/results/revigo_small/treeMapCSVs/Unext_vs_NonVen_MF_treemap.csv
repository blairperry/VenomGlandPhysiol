% WARNING - This is exported REVIGO data useful only for the specific purpose of constructing a TreeMap visualization.
% Do not use this table as a general list of non-redundant GO categories, as it sets an extremely permissive 
% threshold to detect redundancies (c=0.10) and fill the 'representative' column, while normally c>=0.4 is recommended.
% To export a reduced-redundancy set of GO terms, go to the Scatterplot & Table tab, and export to CSV from there.
